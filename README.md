Font for ADHD Readers.

1.Increased Letter Spacing: ADHD readers can experience difficulty with visual crowding. By increasing the space between letters, each character stands out more, reducing the cognitive load required to distinguish letters and words.

2.Clear Character Shapes: Letters with unique and easily recognizable shapes prevent letter confusion, especially for readers who may have trouble maintaining focus. This clarity helps ADHD readers process text more smoothly.

3.Optimized Line Height: Adequate space between lines ensures that ADHD readers can focus on one line at a time, reducing the risk of skipping lines or feeling overwhelmed by dense blocks of text.

4.Balanced Stroke Width: Avoiding extremes in stroke thickness prevents distracting visual contrasts, making the reading experience more consistent and less tiring for ADHD individuals.

5.Gentle Serifs or Sans-serif Style: Fonts with minimal serifs or clean sans-serif designs reduce visual distractions and create a calmer, more structured reading environment, helping ADHD readers stay focused.

6.Consistent Baseline: Ensuring that all characters sit evenly on the baseline makes the text easier to follow, reducing distractions and helping ADHD readers maintain their place in the text.

7.Minimal Decorative Elements: ADHD readers can become easily distracted by unnecessary flourishes. Keeping the font simple and functional ensures the focus remains on the content, not the style.

8.Larger x-height: Increasing the height of lowercase letters enhances readability, making it easier for ADHD readers to recognize and differentiate between characters quickly.

9.Custom Kerning: Proper spacing between specific letter pairs ensures that text is not too tight or too loose, minimizing potential reading interruptions caused by awkward spacing, which can distract ADHD readers.

10.Simple Ascenders and Descenders: By keeping these elements compact yet clear, the font minimizes visual complexity, helping ADHD readers avoid confusion between lines of text while maintaining readability.
